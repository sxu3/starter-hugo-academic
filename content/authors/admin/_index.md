Hi, I am a PhD student of the [Legal Tech Group](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/lt/home/) at the [TU Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/) [School of Computation, Information and Technology](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/startseite/). Previous to that, I worked as a speech scientist at [Nuance Communications](https://www.nuance.com/index.html)/[Cerence](https://www.cerence.com/). I did my master in [Cultural and Cognitive Linguistics](https://www.ats.uni-muenchen.de/studium_lehre/master/index.html) at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html). My research interest is NLP in LegalTech, Computational Social Science and Computational Linguistics. 

I am also an organizer of [MunichðŸ¥¨NLP](https://munich-nlp.github.io/), where I have organized [get-together event](https://munich-nlp.github.io/events/women-get-together-in-nlp/) to support and encourage women in NLP, and am committed to promoting diversity and inclusivity in the field.
